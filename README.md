Hi there! 👋
Over the past few years, I've mostly worked with block coding on Scratch (scratch.mit.edu/users/Cool123games or /RiceGroup). However, I realized Scratch was holding me back and I ended up here. 
I like coding, electronics, and mostly know HTML but have an interest in learning Python 🐍 and Swift 🦅. 
I'm from Brazil, I live in the US, and I don't have favorites 🙃
